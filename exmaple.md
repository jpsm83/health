was viewed as solely for gay sex or a kinky sidedish to the main course, going in through the back door is more and more beingseen as a welcome addition to the sexual menu.‘It's exciting to try new pleasure options and adding anal play onto your menumight mean that you find new ways to expand and potentially enhance yourpleasure, connect with yourself and/or your partner, and explore the erogenouszones[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sexual-health/a704122/female-erogenous-zones/]of your body,’ says Sinclair.Once you've given anal sex[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/g19686611/anal-sex-positions/] ago, it's safe to say you've experienced a whole new world. But if you haven'tand aren't sure where to start, toys can help.WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING AN ANAL SEX TOYAnal sex toys[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a22514579/how-to-use-anal-beads/]are a great way to prepare or ‘train’ the anus for penetration, since the tissuethere is thinner and more prone to damage. ‘You want to start with smaller-sizeproducts and slowly work your way to larger ones, because if you rush tosomething too big too fast, you can cause scratching, tearing, or even scarringof the anal canal,’ explains Sinclair.There are plenty of types of anal sex toys to choose from, whether you’re abeginner or aficionado, including: * Anal beads [https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sexual-health/a42993610/anal-beads/] * Butt plugs [https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sexual-health/g40527514/best-butt-plugs/] * Dildos * Anal vibratorsAs with buying any sex tech, the key is looking for one product that unlocksyour backdoor pleasure. Think about what kind of stimulation you might enjoy —whether you would prefer light stimulation on the outside or inside of the anus,vibrating sensations, full-on penetration, or pegging[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/a39582901/what-is-pegging/] yourpartner — and find a toy that replicates that type of stimulation.Beginners should start with products the size of a finger, Sinclair recommends.‘Seek a product that has a flared base (at least 20% larger than the widest partof the toy),’ she notes.You should also look for anal products[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a29417684/anal-douche/] that read‘body-safe, hypoallergenic, latex-free, and phthalate-free,’ Sinclair advises,as these steer clear of potentially irritating or harmful materials. Silicone,glass, and stainless steel are typically best.Oh, and one more crucial pointer: ‘Do not buy any product for your butt unlessit has a flared base,’ says Sinclair. ‘Products without a flared base can getlost inside the body.’ Uh... no, thanks.HOW WE TEST THE BEST ANAL SEX TOYSbest anal sex toys[https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whanal-sex-toys-testing-6811e40e003f4.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top]Women's Health is lucky enough to be sent the latest sex tech on the market totest, so over the last month our team of sex writers have gotten down tobusiness trying the best anal sex toys — from butt plugs[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sexual-health/g40527514/best-butt-plugs/]to pegging kits and anal beads[https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/health/sexual-health/a42993610/anal-beads/].To make sure only the cream of the crop bless your behinds, we assessed productsfor their features, battery length, waterproof capabilities, ergonomics, andgave bonus points for extras — such as if they came with a travel pouch.14 BEST ANAL SEX TOYS TO SHOP IN 2025Best beginners butt plug all-roundMAUDE CONEOn Sale[/_assets/design-tokens/womenshealthmag/static/images/badges/on-sale.3a06470.svg]Cone[https://hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1652202855-MD_cone_charcoal_02_1600x.jpg?crop=0.689xw:0.689xh;0.138xw,0.170xh&resize=980:*]https://go.redirectingat.com?id=127X1380942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetmaude.com%2Fproducts%2FconeNow 17% Off£19 at maude[https://go.redirectingat.com?id=127X1380942&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgetmaude.com%2Fproducts%2Fcone]PROS * Pro [/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/check-circle-bold.8264626.svg?primary=%252315803D]Long and thin tapered shape makes it ideal for anal newbies * Pro [/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/check-circle-bold.8264626.svg?primary=%252315803D]Soft and bendy silicone * Pro [/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/check-circle-bold.8264626.svg?primary=%252315803D]Suction cup to attach it to different surfacesCONS * Con [/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/x-cross-circle-bold.7de9af1.svg?primary=%2523DC2626]Flared base could be a little biggerAs per Sinclair’s recommendations, this butt plug from Maude (Dakota Johnson’sbrand, FYI) is soft and skinny, making it the perfect addition for first timeanal players.Not only is it free from vibes — which might be a little much if you’re new tothe game — but it’s got a long tapered shape so you can experiment with puttingjust the tip in to start with, before building up to full entry.And, if we’re being *really* anal about it (geddit?) the forest green colour andlittle linen pouch it comes with are a much more visually appealing addition toyour sex toy collection than other anal products on the market.
