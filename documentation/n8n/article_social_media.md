- "sex education" → "intimate wellness education" or "relationship wellness"
- "sexual health" → "intimate wellness" or "personal wellness"
- "sexual wellness" → "intimate wellness" or "personal wellness"
- "sex life" → "intimate life" or "personal wellness"
- "sexual pleasure" → "intimate satisfaction" or "personal wellness"
- "sexual satisfaction" → "intimate satisfaction" or "personal wellness"
- "sexual intimacy" → "intimate connection" or "personal connection"
- "sexual relationship" → "intimate relationship" or "close relationship"

- "toy" (when referring to intimate products)
- "device" (when referring to intimate products)

- Instead of "wellness accessories" → "wellness products" or "self-care items"
- Instead of "wellness devices" → "wellness products" or "personal care items"
- Instead of "intimate accessories" → "intimate wellness products"
