# DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** This content is for a **women's spot app** that covers topics including women's intimate wellness, personal wellness, relationships, health, beauty, nutrition, and weight loss. These topics are educational, informational, and focused on sharing experiences and information about women's daily life - NOT explicit content.

**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** Even though this is educational content about women's and includes some intimate articles, search engines and content filters may flag content with sexual terminology. Always use "intimate wellness," "personal wellness," or "relationship wellness" instead of explicit terms to ensure content safety.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: YOU MUST TRANSLATE THE ARTICLE CONTEXT TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LANGUAGE WHILE MAINTAINING CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS.**

## TRANSLATION PROCESS

**STEP 1: READ THE ARTICLE CONTEXT**

- Analyze the provided article context thoroughly
- Extract the core information and context from the articleContext
- Determine the target language and cultural requirements

**STEP 2: TRANSLATE ARTICLE CONTEXT**

- **articleContext content**: TRANSLATE to target language, but if result exceeds 200 characters, REWRITE to fit within limit

## TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS

- Preserve all factual information and context
- Adapt cultural references to be appropriate for the target culture
- Use natural, fluent language that sounds native to the target language
- Maintain the casual, conversational tone that connects with readers
- **ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS** - Do not add any emojis, symbols, or special characters

### PRODUCT AND MERCHANDISE PRESERVATION
**CRITICAL: When translating content that refers to products, items, merchandise, or anything purchasable, PRESERVE the exact names:**

- **DO NOT translate product names** (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro", "Nike Air Max", "Maybelline Fit Me Foundation")
- **DO NOT translate brand names** (e.g., "Apple", "Samsung", "L'Oreal", "Sephora")
- **DO NOT translate model numbers or product codes** (e.g., "Model XYZ-123", "SKU 456789")
- **DO NOT translate specific item descriptions** that help users identify products for purchase
- **PRESERVE product specifications** that are important for purchasing decisions
- **MAINTAIN exact product titles** as they appear in stores or online marketplaces

- **PRESERVE color names, sizes, and variants** that are crucial for product identification
- **MAINTAIN exact pricing information** if mentioned (though you can update outdated prices)
- **KEEP store names and retailer information** that help users locate products

**This ensures users can easily find and purchase the mentioned products online or in stores regardless of the target language.**

**CHARACTER LIMIT VALIDATION:**
- articleContext â‰¤ 200 chars (TRANSLATE, but if exceeds limit, REWRITE)

**CRITICAL - IMPORTANT: You must follow the rules of *CHARACTER LIMIT VALIDATION* or the api call will fail. Count the characters and adapt them if necessary to follow the max length of article context at all the time.**
