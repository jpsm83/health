  - If the article says "according to Women's Health" → change to "according to Women's Spot"
  - If the article references "our research" or "our studies" from the original source → change to "Women's Spot research" or "Women's Spot studies"
  - Any brand name, publication name, or website name that appears in the article content must be replaced with "Women's Spot"
  - This is CRITICAL for branding consistency - the rewritten article must appear as if it originated from Women's Spot

**LENGTH REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL:**

- **CRITICAL: The new article must have AT LEAST the same quantity of characters as the original**

### 3.2 PRODUCT AND MERCHANDISE PRESERVATION
