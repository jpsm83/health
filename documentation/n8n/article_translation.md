**DO NOT TRANSLATE:**
- Image URLs
- JSON structure
- Social media structure

```json
  {
    "facebook": "some url or the string 'no image'",
    "tiktok": "some url or the string 'no image'",
    "threads": "some url or the string 'no image'",

    "x": "some url or the string 'no image'"
  }
```

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- If ANY content exceeds character limit, REWRITE that specific value to follow the rules
- Count characters for every single field
- NO EXCEPTIONS - every text field must comply with its character limit
- SEO & Social Media: REWRITE based on context to *ENSURE CHARACTERS LIMIT*
- Content: TRANSLATE, no characters limit

**CONSEQUENCES OF NOT FOLLOWING SOCIAL MEDIA RULES:**
- **API ERRORS**: Exceeding character limits will cause social media API calls to fail
- **AUTOMATION FAILURE**: n8n workflows will break if content exceeds platform limits
- **POSTING FAILURES**: Social media posts will be rejected by platform APIs
- **WORKFLOW INTERRUPTION**: Entire automation process will stop due to validation errors
- **DATA CORRUPTION**: Invalid content will cause database inconsistencies
- **USER EXPERIENCE**: Failed posts will result in incomplete social media campaigns

# DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** This content is for a **women's spot app** that covers topics including women's intimate wellness, personal wellness, relationships, health, beauty, nutrition, and weight loss. These topics are educational, informational, and focused on sharing experiences and information about women's daily life - NOT explicit content.

**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** Even though this is educational content about women's and includes some intimate articles, search engines and content filters may flag content with sexual terminology. Always use "intimate wellness," "personal wellness," or "relationship wellness" instead of explicit terms to ensure proper SEO performance and content safety.
