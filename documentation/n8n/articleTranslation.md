**TRANSLATION VS REWRITE REQUIREMENTS:**

# DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** This content is for a **women's spot app** that covers topics including women's intimate wellness, personal wellness, relationships, health, beauty, nutrition, and weight loss. These topics are educational, informational, and focused on sharing experiences and information about women's daily life - NOT explicit content.

**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** Even though this is educational content about women's and includes some intimate articles, search engines and content filters may flag content with sexual terminology. Always use "intimate wellness," "personal wellness," or "relationship wellness" instead of explicit terms to ensure proper SEO performance and content safety.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: YOU MUST TRANSLATE OR REWRITE THE COMPLETE ARTICLE JSON OBJECT TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LANGUAGE WHILE MAINTAINING CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS AND UPDATING ALL SEO ELEMENTS.**

## TRANSLATION OR REWRITE PROCESS

**STEP 1: READ THE COMPLETE ARTICLE JSON OBJECT**

- Analyze the provided complete article JSON object thoroughly
- Identify all translatable content sections
- Extract the core information and context from all sections
- Determine the target language and cultural requirements

**STEP 2: TRANSLATE AND REWRITE CONTENT**
Process the following sections according to their requirements:

- **Article Context**: REWRITE (not translate) - rewrite into target language while maintaining *SAME OR SIMILAR CHARACTER LENGTH* as original, but **MUST NEVER EXCEED 200 CHARACTERS** (critical - article creation will fail if exceeded). Adapt cultural references, preserve factual information
- **SEO content**: REWRITE (not translate) - rewrite metaTitle, metaDescription, keywords, slug to *ENSURE CHARACTERS LIMIT* compliance
- **Article content**: TRANSLATE - mainTitle, all subTitles, all articleParagraphs, no characters limit
- **Social media content**: REWRITE (not translate) - rewrite all text content across all platforms to *ENSURE CHARACTERS LIMIT* compliance
- **Sales Products**: TRANSLATE - translate all product names in the salesProducts array to target language, culturally adapt product terminology to match how products are named on e-commerce websites in that language region

**STEP 3: UPDATE SEO AND URL ELEMENTS**
Update the following elements based on the target language:

- **hreflang**: Replace with the target language code
- **canonicalUrl**: Replace [locale] with target language, translate [category], [slug] as seo.slug
- **metaTitle**: Use content.mainTitle

**CRITICAL CATEGORY TRANSLATION IN CANONICAL URL:**
- **category in canonicalUrl**: Translate the category name (intimacy → intimidad, health → salud, etc.)
  - canonicalUrl: "https://womensspot.org/de/intimitat/article-slug" (category translated)


**STEP 4: PRESERVE NON-TRANSLATABLE ELEMENTS**
Keep the following elements unchanged:

- **All articleImages**: Do not translate any image URLs
- **JSON structure**: Maintain exact same structure and format

## TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS

- Maintain the exact same structure and format as the original
- Preserve all factual information and context
- Adapt cultural references to be appropriate for the target culture
- Use natural, fluent language that sounds native to the target language
- Maintain the casual, conversational tone that connects with readers
- **ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS** - Do not add any emojis, symbols, or special characters
- Ensure all URLs are properly formatted and functional

### PRODUCT AND MERCHANDISE PRESERVATION
**CRITICAL: When translating article content that refers to products, items, merchandise, or anything purchasable, PRESERVE the exact names:**

- **DO NOT translate product names mentioned in article content** (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro", "Nike Air Max", "Maybelline Fit Me Foundation")
- **DO NOT translate brand names mentioned in article content** (e.g., "Apple", "Samsung", "L'Oreal", "Sephora")
- **DO NOT translate model numbers or product codes** (e.g., "Model XYZ-123", "SKU 456789")
- **DO NOT translate specific item descriptions** that help users identify products for purchase
- **PRESERVE product specifications** that are important for purchasing decisions
- **MAINTAIN exact product titles** as they appear in stores or online marketplaces
- **KEEP ingredient lists** for beauty, health, or food products that users need to verify
- **PRESERVE color names, sizes, and variants** that are crucial for product identification
- **MAINTAIN exact pricing information** if mentioned (though you can update outdated prices)
- **KEEP store names and retailer information** that help users locate products

**This ensures users can easily find and purchase the mentioned products online or in stores regardless of the target language.**

### SALES PRODUCTS TRANSLATION
**CRITICAL: The salesProducts array contains generic product recommendations that MUST be translated:**

- **TRANSLATE all product names in the salesProducts array** to the target language
- **CULTURALLY ADAPT product terminology** to match how products are named on e-commerce websites in that language region
- **USE searchable product names** that users would find on online marketplaces in the target language
- **MAINTAIN the same number of products** as in the original array
- **PRESERVE product relevance** - ensure translated products are still relevant to the article topic
- **USE natural, native product terminology** for the target language market

**Example translations:**
- EN: "Running Shoes" → PT: "Tênis de Corrida" → ES: "Zapatillas para Correr" → FR: "Chaussures de Course" → DE: "Laufschuhe" → IT: "Scarpe da Corsa"
- EN: "Protein Powder" → PT: "Proteína em Pó" → ES: "Proteína en Polvo" → FR: "Poudre de Protéine" → DE: "Proteinpulver" → IT: "Proteina in Polvere"
