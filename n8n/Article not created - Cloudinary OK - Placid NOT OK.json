The composition focuses on self-exploration, empowerment, and intimate wellness without explicit content.\"\n- \"Two women in casual, comfortable clothing sharing a warm conversation over coffee in a bright, modern café. They are smiling and engaged, symbolizing openness and positive attitudes around intimacy and personal wellness.

PRE-SUBMISSION SAFETY CHECKLIST\n\nBefore generating any image description, verify that your prompt:\n\n**PEOPLE:** Uses only generic terms like \"a woman\", \"a person\", \"people\" - NO specific names\n**CONTENT:** Focuses on positive, educational, women's wellness topics including intimate wellness, relationships, and personal wellness\n**SETTINGS:** Uses wholesome, everyday environments (home, office, garden, café)\n**ACTIVITIES:** Describes safe, positive activities (reading, cooking, exercising, socializing)\n**LANGUAGE:** Uses clear, unambiguous language that cannot be misinterpreted\n**TONE:** Maintains a positive, uplifting, and educational tone\n**KEYWORDS:** Has reframed all potentially blocked keywords using safe alternatives\n**CONTEXT:** Includes safe context words like \"educational,\" \"wellness,\" \"intimacy,\" \"empowerment\"\n**COMPLIANCE:** Follows all OpenAI DALL-E safety guidelines\n**TESTING:** Has been reviewed for potential safety violations\n\n**REMEMBER:** If in doubt, err on the side of caution. It's better to create a simple, safe prompt than to risk rejection by OpenAI's safety system.\n\n## 6.

No other format is acceptable.**\n\n**MANDATORY JSON STRUCTURE:**\n{\n  \"instagram\": {\n    \"caption\": \"Engaging caption with call-to-action - MAX 2200 characters (NO hashtags in caption, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n    \"hashtags\": \"#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5\",\n    \"altText\": \"Accessibility text describing the image - MAX 1000 characters (NO hashtags, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n  },\n  \"facebook\": {\n    \"message\": \"Engaging message with educational content - MAX 63206 characters (NO hashtags in message, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n    \"headline\": \"Compelling headline - MAX 100 characters (NO hashtags)\",\n    \"linkDescription\": \"Link preview description - MAX 300 characters (NO hashtags)\",\n    \"hashtags\": \"#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5\",\n    \"callToAction\": \"Learn More\",\n  },\n  \"xTwitter\": {\n    \"text\": \"Engaging tweet - MAX 280 characters (NO hashtags in text)\",\n    \"hashtags\": \"#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5\",\n  },\n  \"pinterest\": {\n    \"title\": \"Compelling pin title - MAX 100 characters (NO hashtags)\",\n    \"description\": \"Detailed pin description - MAX 500 characters (NO hashtags, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n    \"hashtags\": \"#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5\",\n    \"altText\": \"Accessibility text describing the image - MAX 500 characters (NO hashtags, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n  },\n  \"threads\": {\n    \"text\": \"Engaging thread post - MAX 500 characters (NO hashtags in text, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n    \"hashtags\": \"#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5\",\n  },\n  \"tiktok\": {\n    \"title\": \"Engaging TikTok title - MAX 90 characters (NO hashtags)\",\n    \"caption\": \"Engaging TikTok caption - MAX 2200 characters (NO hashtags in caption, but the max chars should include the length of the hashatags)\",\n    \"hashtags\": \"#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5\",\n  }\n}\n\n**JSON FORMAT VALIDATION RULES:**\n1. **MUST start with `{` and end with `}`**\n2. **MUST have exactly 7 social media platforms: `instagram`, `facebook`, `xTwitter`, `pinterest`, `threads`, `tiktok`**\n3. **MUST use double quotes for all keys and string values**\n4. **MUST NOT include any text before or after the JSON**\n5. **MUST NOT include any comments or explanations outside the JSON**\n6. **MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed by a JSON parser**\n\n**ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN:**\n- **Do NOT create content longer than specified character limits - this will cause API errors**\n- **Do NOT include more hashtags than allowed per platform - this will cause API errors**\n- **Do NOT include hashtags in any content fields (caption, message, headline, text, title, description, altText) - hashtags ONLY belong in the dedicated hashtags field**\n- **Do NOT assume \"close enough\" - exact compliance is mandatory**\n- **Do NOT skip character counting - verify every single field**\n- **Do NOT ignore character limits - every single property must comply**\n- **Do NOT create content that would cause API errors**\n- Do NOT add any emojis, symbols, or special characters in any content\n- Do NOT make up false information\n- Do NOT change the core meaning or context\n- Do NOT output in any format other than the specified JSON\n- Do NOT include explicit, suggestive, or inappropriate terminology\n- Do NOT create content that would violate social media guidelines\n- Do NOT include content that could be flagged by content filters\n\n**JSON FORMATTING ERRORS TO AVOID:**\n- Do NOT add any text before or after the JSON object\n- Do NOT use single quotes instead of double quotes\n- Do NOT add trailing commas after the last item in objects or arrays\n- Do NOT include comments or explanations outside the JSON\n- Do NOT use backticks or markdown formatting around the JSON\n- Do NOT add line breaks or extra spaces that break JSON parsing\n- Do NOT include any characters that are not valid JSON\n- Do NOT add any prefix like \"Here is the JSON:\" or \"The result is:\"\n\n**CRITICAL: Your response must be ONLY the JSON object, nothing else.**\n```",

Translate ONLY content section to {{ $('Languages array').item.json.language }}\n2. REWRITE SEO and socialMedia content (not translate) to *ENSURE CHARACTERS LIMIT*\n3. Update hreflang, urlPattern, canonicalUrl, slug\n4. Use language mappings for articles and categories\n5. German slugs: replace umlauts (ä→a, ö→o, ü→u, ß→ss)\n6. CRITICAL: Respect *ALL CHARACTERS LIMIT* - if exceeded, rewrite that specific value to follow the rules\n7. Keep image URLs unchanged\n8. Output only the complete JSON object\n\n**CRITICAL URL PATTERN RULES:**\n- urlPattern: Use EXACT patterns (articles, artigos, articulos, artikel, articoli)\n- category in canonicalUrl: Translate category names (intimacy → intimidad, etc.)\n- DO NOT use translated category names as urlPattern\n- DO NOT translate urlPattern - use exact mappings\n```\n\n---\n\n# DETAILED DOCUMENTATION\n\n**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:** This content is for a **women's spot app** that covers topics including women's intimate wellness, personal wellness, relationships, health, beauty, nutrition, and weight loss. These topics are educational, informational, and focused on sharing experiences and information about women's daily life - NOT explicit content.\n\n**CRITICAL SAFETY NOTE:** Even though this is educational content about women's and includes some intimate articles, search engines and content filters may flag content with sexual terminology. Always use \"intimate wellness,\" \"personal wellness,\" or \"relationship wellness\" instead of explicit terms to ensure proper SEO performance and content safety.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: YOU MUST TRANSLATE OR REWRITE THE COMPLETE ARTICLE JSON OBJECT TO THE SPECIFIED TARGET LANGUAGE WHILE MAINTAINING CULTURAL APPROPRIATENESS AND UPDATING ALL URL PATTERNS AND SEO ELEMENTS.**\n\n## TRANSLATION OR REWRITE PROCESS\n\n**STEP 1: READ THE COMPLETE ARTICLE JSON OBJECT**\n\n- Analyze the provided complete article JSON object thoroughly\n- Identify all translatable content sections\n- Extract the core information and context from all sections\n- Determine the target language and cultural requirements\n\n**STEP 2: TRANSLATE AND REWRITE CONTENT**\nProcess the following sections according to their requirements:\n\n- **SEO content**: REWRITE (not translate) - rewrite metaTitle, metaDescription, keywords, slug to *ENSURE CHARACTERS LIMIT* compliance\n- **Article content**: TRANSLATE - mainTitle, all subTitles, all articleParagraphs, no characters limit\n- **Social media content**: REWRITE (not translate) - rewrite all text content across all platforms to *ENSURE CHARACTERS LIMIT* compliance\n\n**STEP 3: UPDATE SEO AND URL ELEMENTS**\nUpdate the following elements based on the target language:\n\n- **hreflang**: Replace with the target language code\n- **urlPattern**: Use EXACT pattern from mappings (articles, artigos, articulos, artikel, articoli)\n- **canonicalUrl**: Replace [locale] with target language, translate [category], [slug] as seo.slug\n- **metaTitle**: Use content.mainTitle\n\n**CRITICAL URL PATTERN PROCESSING:**\n- **urlPattern**: Use the EXACT pattern from the language mappings (NOT translated category)\n- **category in canonicalUrl**: Translate the category name (intimacy → intimidad, health → salud, etc.)\n- **Example**: For German intimacy article:\n  - urlPattern: \"artikel\" (NOT \"intimita\")\n  - canonicalUrl: \"https://womensspot.org/de/intimitat/article-slug\" (category translated)\n\n\n**STEP 4: PRESERVE NON-TRANSLATABLE ELEMENTS**\nKeep the following elements unchanged:\n\n- **All articleImages**: Do not translate any image URLs\n- **JSON structure**: Maintain exact same structure and format\n\n## TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS\n\n- Maintain the exact same structure and format as the original\n- Preserve all factual information and context\n- Adapt cultural references to be appropriate for the target culture\n- Use natural, fluent language that sounds native to the target language\n- Maintain the casual, conversational tone that connects with readers\n- **ABSOLUTELY NO EMOJIS** - Do not add any emojis, symbols, or special characters\n- Ensure all URLs are properly formatted and functional\n\n### PRODUCT AND MERCHANDISE PRESERVATION\n**CRITICAL: When translating content that refers to products, items, merchandise, or anything purchasable, PRESERVE the exact names:**\n\n- **DO NOT translate product names** (e.g., \"iPhone 15 Pro\", \"Nike Air Max\", \"Maybelline Fit Me Foundation\")\n- **DO NOT translate brand names** (e.g., \"Apple\", \"Samsung\", \"L'Oreal\", \"Sephora\")\n- **DO NOT translate model numbers or product codes** (e.g., \"Model XYZ-123\", \"SKU 456789\")\n- **DO NOT translate specific item descriptions** that help users identify products for purchase\n- **PRESERVE product specifications** that are important for purchasing decisions\n- **MAINTAIN exact product titles** as they appear in stores or online marketplaces\n- **KEEP ingredient lists** for beauty, health, or food products that users need to verify\n- **PRESERVE color names, sizes, and variants** that are crucial for product identification\n- **MAINTAIN exact pricing information** if mentioned (though you can update outdated prices)\n- **KEEP store names and retailer information** that help users locate products\n\n**This ensures users can easily find and purchase the mentioned products online or in stores regardless of the target language.**\n\n**CRITICAL ERROR PREVENTION: These fields are currently being incorrectly translated to English. They MUST remain in their original language as provided in the input.**\n\n## REWRITE REQUIREMENTS (SEO & Social Media)\n\n- **SEO content**: REWRITE based on context, not translate - ensure metaTitle, metaDescription, keywords, and slug comply with character limits\n- **Social Media content**: REWRITE based on context, not translate - ensure each property complies with its specific character limit\n- **Purpose**: Rewriting ensures character limits are met while maintaining the core message and context\n- **Approach**: Use the original content as context to create new, shorter content that conveys the same message\n- **Quality**: Maintain the same tone, style, and informational value as the original\n\n**CHARACTER LIMIT VALIDATION:**\n- metaTitle ≤ 500 chars (REWRITE)\n- metaDescription ≤ 1000 chars (REWRITE)\n- Instagram caption ≤ 2200 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- Instagram hashtags ≤ 30 items (REWRITE)\n- Instagram altText ≤ 1000 chars (REWRITE)\n- Facebook message ≤ 63206 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- Facebook headline ≤ 100 chars (REWRITE)\n- Facebook linkDescription ≤ 300 chars (REWRITE)\n- Facebook hashtags: No strict limit but must follow limit of chars (REWRITE)\n- Facebook callToAction ≤ 30 chars (REWRITE)\n- X/Twitter text ≤ 280 chars for free accounts including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- X/Twitter hashtags: No strict limit but must follow limit of chars (REWRITE)\n- Pinterest title ≤ 100 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- Pinterest description ≤ 500 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- Pinterest hashtags: No strict limit but must follow limit of chars (REWRITE)\n- Pinterest altText ≤ 500 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- Threads text ≤ 500 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- Threads hashtags: No strict limit but must follow limit of chars (REWRITE)\n- TikTok title ≤ 90 chars (REWRITE)\n- TikTok caption ≤ 2200 chars including hashtags (REWRITE)\n- TikTok hashtags: No strict limit but must follow limit of chars (REWRITE)\n\n**CRITICAL - IMPORTANT: You must follow the rules of *CHARACTER LIMIT VALIDATION* or the api call will fail. Count the characters and adapt them if necessary to follow the max length of each individual social media, SEO, and media context at all the time.**\n\n## CULTURAL ADAPTATION\n\n- Adapt examples and references to be culturally relevant\n- Use appropriate cultural expressions and idioms\n- Ensure content is respectful and appropriate for the target culture\n- Maintain the same educational and informative value\n- Keep the same emotional tone and connection with readers\n- Translate category names to be culturally appropriate\n\n## CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES\n\n- **SEO & Social Media**: REWRITE (not translate) to ensure character limits are met\n- **Content**: TRANSLATE, no character limitation on this\n- **Hashtags are part of the text and must be included and count for rules of max characters limit**\n- If ANY property exceeds its limit, you MUST rewrite that specific value to follow the rules\n- Count characters carefully for each individual property\n- This applies to ALL nested properties in seo, content, and socialMedia\n- NO EXCEPTIONS - every single text field must comply\n\n## CONSEQUENCES OF NOT FOLLOWING RULES\n\n- **API ERRORS**: Exceeding character limits will cause social media API calls to fail\n- **AUTOMATION FAILURE**: n8n workflows will break if content exceeds platform limits\n- **POSTING FAILURES**: Social media posts will be rejected by platform APIs\n- **WORKFLOW INTERRUPTION**: Entire automation process will stop due to validation errors\n- **DATA CORRUPTION**: Invalid content will cause database inconsistencies\n- **USER EXPERIENCE**: Failed posts will result in incomplete social media campaigns\n\n## ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN\n\n- **Do NOT use invalid URL patterns - MUST use exact patterns: \"articles\", \"artigos\", \"articulos\", \"artikel\", \"articoli\"**\n- **Do NOT create custom URL patterns - use only the exact patterns listed above**\n- **Do NOT use category names as URL patterns - use the language-specific patterns**\n- **Do NOT translate URL patterns - use the exact mappings provided**\n- Do NOT change the core meaning or context of any content\n- Do NOT add any emojis, symbols, or special characters in any content\n- Do NOT make up false information\n- Do NOT create inappropriate cultural references\n- Do NOT output in any format other than the specified JSON\n- **Do NOT exceed character limits for ANY content - if exceeded, rewrite to follow the rules**\n- **Do NOT translate SEO or socialMedia content - REWRITE instead**\n- Do NOT create translations that are culturally insensitive\n- Do NOT change the JSON structure or field names\n- **Do NOT ignore character limits - every single property must comply**\n- **Do NOT assume \"close enough\" - exact compliance is mandatory**\n- **Do NOT skip character counting - verify every single field**\n- **Do NOT translate product names, brand names, merchandise, or purchasable items - preserve exact names**\n\n## ONLY ALLOWED\n\n- Read, understand and process content from the complete article JSON object\n- **SEO & Social Media**: REWRITE (not translate) based on context to ensure character limits\n- **Content**: TRANSLATE to the specified target language\n- Update hreflang, urlPattern, and canonicalUrl based on target language\n- Maintain all non-translatable elements (URLs, images)\n- Structure content into the required JSON format\n- **Count characters for every single property to ensure compliance**\n- **SEO content**: Must comply with character limits (REWRITE)\n- **Social Media content**: Must comply with platform-specific character limits (REWRITE)\n- **PRESERVE exact product names, brand names, merchandise, and purchasable items** -
