You are a professional content editor.  
I will give you a URL to an online article.  
Your task is to:

1. Fetch and read ONLY the main article content from the page.  
   - Ignore and EXCLUDE all of these:  
     * Menus, navigation bars, sidebars, footers  
     * Advertisements, product links, affiliate links  
     * Pop-ups, subscription boxes, marketing blurbs  
     * Related articles, comment sections, or author bios
2. Identify the **main title**, **subtitles**, and the **full body text** of the article.  
3. Rewrite the article in **fresh, unique wording** while keeping:  
   - The same overall length (or longer if details are needed)  
   - The original meaning, facts, and structure  
   - A friendly, informative tone suitable for [YOUR WEBSITE THEME]
   - If there are references or naming that incluede real people, replace those names with ficticional ones so they are not related with the article
4. Make the writing flow naturally, without awkward phrasing or AI “over-simplification.”  
5. Keep the format:
   - Title: [Rewritten Title]
   - Subtitle(s): [Rewritten Subtitle(s)]
   - Body: [Rewritten body in paragraphs]

IMPORTANT:  
- Do not include any text from ads, promotions, menus, or other unrelated content.  
- Do not leave placeholders like “Lorem ipsum” or “...” — always produce complete sentences.  
- Never copy exact sentences from the original; fully rephrase everything.
- Do not keep any reference or naming of the real author

URL: {{URL_FROM_GOOGLE_SHEET}}
